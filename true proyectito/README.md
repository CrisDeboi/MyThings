# Distribution of Dr. Negrin University Hospital

We would like to offer a guide to the distribution of one of the largest hospitals in the Canary Islands, the Doctor Negrin Hospital, located in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Barranco de la Ballena s/n street. 
It has a section A and B and each of them with a right and left side and a total of 6 floors.

## Getting Started

We want to offer a visual guide so that each user that observes the created file can know in which plant is his specialty or the other way around, see which specialty is in a plant. To do this we recommend viewing the code created in preview or raw mode.
