## My Web Project 

## About

Greetings, I wanted to create a little web for a class project about, for my example, a seed shop to have a beatiful garden.
The idea of this project is to build a web using HTML,CSS and JS and mainly focusing on having flexboxes with media queries
along all the project. It also has to have particular styles like hover effects and a minor javascript function, in this
example I used javascript for showing a side menu.

I used a library for the icons, which is: https://fontawesome.com/icons

I tried to use this web as reference: https://dribbble.com/shots/17396277-Web-site-design-landing-page-home-page-ui
I liked the idea of this example web of having a header and right below it a subheader which contains other information,
and then, the gallery of products that I offer in my web
